# My First Games and Projects with Godot

Welcome to the repository where I stash my initial games and projects developed using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). This repository serves as a collection of my learning journey and experimentation with game development. Here you'll find various small projects, prototypes, and experimental features that I've worked on to get familiar with the capabilities of Godot.

## Projects

Here is a list of some projects you'll find in this repository:

1.**Platformer Prototype**: A simple platformer game to experiment with physics, collisions, and character movement.
2.**More to come**

Each project is contained within its own directory with all the necessary assets, scripts, and scenes.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects in this repository, you'll need to have the Godot Engine installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Godot website](https://godotengine.org/download).

### Prerequisites

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download) (version 3.x or 4.x)
- A code editor (optional, but recommended) such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (take into account that Godot has its own integrated code editor)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lukeslater0961/godot_testing.git
2. Now you have **2** choices
   * You can go into the **exported_games** folder and unzip the game folder you want to test and just play it
   * You can open th eproject by goign straight into the **game n** folder and importing the godot file into godot
